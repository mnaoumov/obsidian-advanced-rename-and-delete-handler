// Keeps the in-repo `demo-vault/` in sync with the plugin's public surface WITHOUT
// Launching Obsidian: it reflects the real config from source and asserts every
// Setting is documented in a note, and that the guard note/member still exist
// (rename drift). This plugin exposes no public API interface — it owns rename and
// Delete handling for the vault and is configured entirely through its settings — so
// Only the PluginSettings config class is reflected.
