/**
 * The API this plugin publishes for other plugins to call.
 *
 * Copy this file into your own plugin: it imports nothing at all, so it costs you no dependency on this plugin and none
 * on `obsidian-dev-utils`. That is why {@link EmptyFolderBehavior} — which the plugin itself takes from that library as
 * an enum — is inlined below as a plain string-literal union. It carries the same runtime values the plugin uses.
 *
 * The API is reached through the `obsidian-dev-utils` cross-plugin API registry, keyed by the plugin id
 * `advanced-rename-and-delete-handler` and version-negotiated against its CONTRACT version, which moves independently of
 * the plugin's own `manifest.version`. `1.1.0` added the three read-back members to `1.0.0`'s `migrateSettings`, purely
 * additively, so ask for `^1`. The README's `For plugin developers` section shows both routes: `watchPluginApi` for a
 * consumer that already has `obsidian-dev-utils`, and the library-free registry read for one that does not.
